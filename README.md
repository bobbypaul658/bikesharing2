###
Kate bike share with Citibike has been a huge success. She was able to demostrate the peak usage hour. She is able to break it down by gender, realizing their is huge opportunity to gain with women. If Kate wanted to do more she could map  a starting location to ending stop during peak hours. We can also examine the trip duration time by gender, the year they are born. We can also examine if outsiders people not from New York use the CitiBike program.
